# @romudille/agentpay-mcp

**The economic-intelligence layer for AI agents.** Most agent-payment tools are a wallet —
they move money. AgentPay is the layer that decides whether to spend it at all: a hard
budget cap enforced at the payment layer, cost awareness before every call, and a
verifiable receipt after.

Self-contained Node MCP server (Node ≥ 18). No Python, no repo, no wallet, no API keys.
17 free tools work out of the box, plus **`verified_route`** — a keyless buyer-side *trust
preview* that vets the x402 marketplace (sweep → drop stubs & sybil factories → rank by real
unique-payer usage) and names the real, used provider for your need. It withholds the
ready-to-pay payload by design; the full multi-query sweep + ready-to-pay challenge come from
the paid `verified_route` ($0.01) via the `agentpay-x402` SDK. (`route` is kept as a legacy
alias; `estimate_plan` prices a multi-tool plan before you spend.)

Gateway: `https://agentpay.tools`

## Quick Start (zero config)

```bash
npx -y @romudille/agentpay-mcp
```

Or add to your MCP client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agentpay": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@romudille/agentpay-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Keyless by default — an ephemeral identity runs the x402 free-flow for all 17 free tools.
No wallet or funding needed to start.

## Tools (18 — 17 free)

All data tools are **free**; only `session_create` settles on-chain.

## Pay for tools (Python SDK)

The Node server is keyless and runs the free tools. To settle paid tools and get hard
budget caps + receipts, use the Python SDK:

```bash
pip install agentpay-x402
```

```python
from agentpay import quickstart
s = quickstart(max_spend=0.10)              # one hard cap, no funding to start
print(s.call("token_price", {"symbol": "ETH"}).data["price_usd"])
print(s.spending_summary())                 # receipt: every call, cost, tx, chain
```
