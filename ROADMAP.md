# AgentPay Roadmap

Last updated: April 26, 2026

---

## Engineering Hardening (post-DoraHacks judge feedback)

DoraHacks judges (April 2026) confirmed AgentPay's mainnet deployment is verifiable and called the budget-aware `Session` with hard spend caps "a genuinely useful primitive for agent safety." Score was held back by: no automated test coverage, in-memory-only state, incomplete code paths, and less architectural depth than projects with Soroban contracts or full SDK/middleware stacks. This track addresses each gap directly and frames the Instaward funding trajectory.

### Tier 1 — Cleanup ✅ Done April 25, 2026

Sub-30-minute fixes that removed the most visible "shipped without running it" signals.

- ✅ Fixed Base Mode B `rpc` → `rpc_url` NameError (`gateway/base.py:230`)
- ✅ Fixed `dex_liquidity` POST 404 — alias resolution applied to POST (`gateway/main.py:329`)
- ✅ Network reported correctly in Base payment receipts (`gateway/main.py:519-521`)
- ✅ `parse_payment_header(x_payment)["id"]` replaces brittle string split (`gateway/main.py:502`)
- ✅ Base advertised in HEAD pre-flight + `X-Payment-Required` header (`gateway/main.py:285-304`, `gateway/x402.py:90`)
- ✅ `BASE_NETWORK` default aligned with README (`gateway/config.py`)
- ✅ Empty `tx_hash` rejected in `parse_payment_header` (`gateway/x402.py:114`)
- ✅ Local working tree cleaned — `paper_trade_log.txt` and friends gone

### Tier 2 — Round 1 scope (May 2026): SDK + code improvements + landing

Round 1 leads with the dream feature (the SDK extension), pairs it with the production-grade hardening that removes the most embarrassing rough edges, and ships the user-friendly landing surface that's been blocked on the custom domain. Soroban settlement deferred to Round 2 — premature without users.

**D1 — Bounded-autonomy SDK + cost intelligence (Claude only):**

- `session.llm.claude(prompt, model)` — wraps Claude calls under the same `Session(max_spend=)` meter that already covers data calls. Two paths in one SDK:
  - **Production path**: dev brings their own `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; SDK calls Anthropic directly. Zero markup, zero proxy, zero capital risk.
  - **Demo path**: first 10 calls per anonymous user route through an AgentPay-hosted Haiku endpoint. Removes the "go create an Anthropic account first" onboarding friction. Costs us ~$0.005 per first-time user, capped at ~100 users/day.
- `Session.cost_breakdown()` — per-call ledger (tool, price, timestamp) for true P&L attribution across data + Claude calls.
- `Session.should_call(tool, expected_value_usd)` — turns the passive cap into an active decision surface.
- Hero demo `examples/weekend_bot.py` — bot bounded end-to-end by a single $20 budget covering both data and reasoning.
- Released as `agentpay-x402 v1.2.0` (PyPI) and `@romudille/agentpay-mcp v1.2.0` (npm).
- OpenAI integration deferred to Round 2.

**D2 — Code improvements:**

The fixes that make the gateway not embarrassing when devs poke at it. Each item closes a real bug or a measurable performance gap.

- **Pytest suite + GitHub Actions CI** — coverage on `gateway/x402.py`, `gateway/base.py`, `gateway/stellar.py` (happy + replay paths, mocked Horizon and JSON-RPC). Coverage badge in README. Closes the judge-cited #1 execution gap.
- **Refund / credit semantics on tool failure** — unify the three current failure modes that all silently keep the agent's money. Pick one rule, document it, enforce it.
- **Stellar facilitator fallback covers all non-200 cases** (not just 401). Plus flag-gate the OZ facilitator branch (`STELLAR_FACILITATOR_ENABLED=false` default) or remove it. **Removes the 15-second dead timeout currently sitting on every Stellar payment** — users feel this immediately.
- **Async safety** — wrap the three Stellar SDK call sites (`stellar.py:split_payment`, `main.py:_provision_wallet`, `main.py:get_usdc_balance`) in `asyncio.to_thread(...)`. Removes 5–10s event loop stalls under concurrency.
- **CDP Mode A schema validation** — sanity-check Base mainnet response shape before trusting `tx_hash` (`base.py:263-270`).

**D3 — Landing & user-friendly UI** — 🚨 **PULLED FORWARD to active week (May 20–24, 2026).** Originally Week 4 of the Instaward SOW; reprioritised to Week 1 as the unblocker for everything else. D1 (Claude SDK) and D2 (code hardening) continue in parallel afterward. The Instaward SOW timing is independently tracked — see `ROADMAP_OBSERVABILITY.md` §Instaward Round 1 alignment for the funding boundary.

Where users actually land. Currently `agentpay.tools` doesn't resolve and there's no landing surface — the biggest discoverability blocker we have. Without this surface live, every other piece of engineering (D1 SDK, D4 observability, CCTP integration) lands on an invisible wall.

5-day execution plan for this week:

- **Day 1 — Resolve `agentpay.tools`.** DNS + Railway custom domain settings. ~30 minutes of actual work but currently blocking everything else. Verify HTTPS, redirect www → apex, point `/.well-known/*` and `/llms.txt` at the existing gateway endpoints.
- **Day 2 — Bazaar `outputSchema` fix** in `gateway/base.py:build_payment_required_header` — embed each tool's `parameters` + `response_example` from the registry as `outputSchema` in the `accepts` array. Trigger one Base mainnet payment through the CDP facilitator to seed indexing. Unlocks automatic indexing in Coinbase's Bazaar directory.
  - **Why both networks matter strategically**: Bazaar lives on Base, so it's our discovery channel inside the Coinbase ecosystem. But for AgentPay's $0.001–$0.005 tool prices, Stellar settles at ~$0.000001 per transaction vs. Base's ~$0.001–$0.01 per transaction in gas. **Discovery on Base, settlement on Stellar** — users find us through the Coinbase directory, then choose Stellar at runtime where the economics actually work for sub-cent micropayments. With CCTP now live on Stellar (May 2026), this story extends to "fund from any of 23 chains, pay on Stellar at sub-cent."
- **Day 3 — Landing page** at `agentpay.tools` — Segment 1 hero ("Run your trading bot on a fixed data budget"), 5-line code snippet, link to Glama/MCP, link to GitHub, testnet faucet CTA. One page, not a marketing site. Landing copy explicitly references the [Stellar Foundation's official x402 docs](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/agentic-payments/x402) and the [Foundation's x402 blog post](https://stellar.org/blog/foundation-news/x402-on-stellar) as positioning anchors — AgentPay is the production-grade implementation of the Foundation's published x402-MCP roadmap.
- **Day 4 — README tighten + launch tweet.** Coverage badge, accurate Base section, link to the live landing. Launch thread pinned to AgentPay Twitter: "live on Stellar + Base mainnet, 5-line example, here's the Bazaar listing." Cross-post to Stellar Discord, x402 Discord, awesome-x402 issue tracker.
- **Day 5 — CCTP tweet + first-traffic watch.** Single tweet referencing Circle's CCTP-on-Stellar news, positioning AgentPay as the Stellar-native x402 endpoint that's CCTP-funding-compatible. First real traffic from launch generates more prioritization signal than any planning document.

Deferred from this week to a later week (still in D3 scope, just not blocking discovery):

- **Sponsored agent account integration** — wire the SDK / CLI to optionally bootstrap a Stellar wallet via the [stellar-sponsored-agent-account](https://github.com/oceans404/stellar-sponsored-agent-account) service (forked + self-hosted to remove dependency risk; ~$10/month in sponsor XLM). Pairs with the Claude Haiku demo path in D1 — between them, a first-time user can call `session.llm.claude(...)` and `session.call("token_price", ...)` without holding any crypto or any account anywhere. ~1 day of work. Schedule for the week after D1 SDK launch.
- **60-second weekend-bot demo video** — recorded once, embedded on landing, pinned to Twitter. Polish, not unlock — record after D1 ships so the demo includes the bounded Claude call.
- **Brand basics** — refined logo, color palette, simple style guide PDF. Enough to feel intentional. Defer to after the first traffic numbers exist.

### Tier 3 — Round 2 candidate scope (June 2026)

Architectural depth + persistence + distribution + OpenAI integration.

- **Soroban escrow + atomic split contract on testnet** — receives the agent's USDC payment, splits 85/15 atomically, emits a `PaymentSettled` event the gateway listens for. Gateway becomes a relay, not a custodian. Closes the judges' "architectural depth / Soroban contracts" critique. Round 1 deferred this because the trust-the-gateway concern doesn't bite without users; Round 2 ships it once the user base from Round 1 makes it relevant.
- **Move replay state to Supabase**: `_completed_payments`, `_used_base_tx_hashes`, `_pending_challenges`, `_FAUCET_IP_LOG`. Replay protection on **both** `tx_hash` AND `payment_id`.
- **`payment_logs` audit trail** — row inserted before `split_payment(...)` + updated on result. Turns the fire-and-forget split into a queryable audit trail.
- **OpenAI integration** in the SDK — `session.llm.openai(prompt, model)`. Deferred from Round 1; revisit after Claude SDK gets real usage and we know what shape OpenAI's onboarding constraints will take.
- **Per-agent rate limiting** — keyed on `agent_address`, not IP (currently `slowapi` keys on IP).
- **Distribution sprint** — 10 tweets + 1 thread + 3 Discord intros + 20-dev outreach list targeting trading bot devs whose strategies combine cheap polling with selective premium calls.

### Tier 4 — Round 3 candidate scope (July 2026)

Soroban mainnet + advanced primitives.

- **Soroban contract mainnet rollout** — audit + per-payment-path migration from gateway-mediated split to contract-mediated split.
- **Budget escrow held in Soroban** — agent locks $20 in the contract; contract releases per call against a verified payment intent. Removes the need for the agent to hold balance per-tool-call.
- **Multi-agent budget pools** — one budget shared across N agent processes via the contract.
- **Lock down `/stats` and tighten CORS** (`allow_origins=["*"]` → documented frontends only).
- **Auth-gate or strip agent addresses** from public `/stats`.

### Tier 5 — Hygiene (continuous, no specific round)

Do once, never think about again.

- ✅ Split `gateway/main.py` (2,237 lines) into routes + services modules — done April 26.
- ✅ Dedupe `agent/wallet.py` vs `agentpay/_wallet.py` — done April 26.
- 🔜 README polish after Round 1 lands: CI badge, accurate Base section, accurate test instructions, link to deployed Soroban contract.
- 🔜 Replace silent `except: pass` patterns with logged warnings (`agent/wallet.py:295/308`, `stellar.py:281-282`).
- 🔜 `_FAUCET_COOLDOWN_SECS` documentation alignment — code says 600s, comment says 24 hours, docstring says "one wallet per IP per 24 hours." Pick a number.

## Week 1 — Done ✅

**`dex_liquidity` → `token_market_data`**
- Renamed in registry + Supabase, price $0.003 → $0.001
- Description corrected (no longer claims to return pool depth)
- `volume_change_24h_pct` now surfaced in response
- Legacy name still routed in gateway for backward compatibility

**`whale_activity` direction classification**
- Added `_EXCHANGE_WALLETS` dict — 33 addresses across Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, OKX, Bybit, Bitfinex, Gemini, Huobi, Gate.io
- Each transfer now includes `direction` (exchange_inflow / exchange_outflow / wallet_to_wallet) and `exchange_name`
- Response includes `direction_summary` counts
- Monthly scheduled audit created to find missing exchanges (runs 1st of each month)

**`dune_query` fast_only mode**
- New `fast_only` boolean param (default `False`)
- When `True`: returns cached result immediately or raises — never executes a fresh query
- Schema updated in registry + Supabase

---

## Week 2 — In Progress

Free public APIs, no new keys needed.

**NEW `open_interest`** — ✅ Live on mainnet
- Total OI + 1h/24h change across Binance + Bybit
- Long/short ratio from Binance globalLongShortAccountRatio
- Testnet verified April 16, 2026 — mainnet deploy confirmed live April 21, 2026

**NEW `orderbook_depth`** — ✅ Live on mainnet
- Real bid/ask depth + slippage at $10k / $50k / $250k notional
- Binance primary, Bybit fallback; `exchange` param to override
- Testnet verified April 16, 2026 — mainnet deploy confirmed live April 21, 2026

**FIX `token_price`** — batch + volume 🔜
- Add `volume_24h` to single-token response (already in CoinGecko payload)
- Add multi-symbol batch: one $0.002 call for up to 5 tokens
- CoinGecko `/simple/price` already accepts comma-separated ids — half a day

**FIX `gas_tracker`** — multi-chain 🔜
- Add `chain` param: arbitrum, base, polygon, optimism
- Same Etherscan V2 key, different `chainid` values (42161, 8453, 137, 10)
- Half a day

**The demo after Week 2:**
> "My bot read funding rates (+0.08%/8h on ETH), confirmed rising open interest (+12% in 24h), checked orderbook depth ($0.31% slippage on a $250k sell), and decided not to open the short. Total data cost: $0.006."

## Month 2 — On-chain intelligence

Requires paid APIs (~$80/month total if both). Prioritise by revenue.

**NEW `liquidation_heatmap`** — $0.003
- Recent liquidation volume + key price levels where large clusters sit
- Most-discussed signal in Freqtrade community
- Source: Coinglass liquidation API — free tier 100 req/day, paid ~$30/month
- Output: `{asset, recent_liquidations_1h_usd, liq_long_usd, liq_short_usd, key_levels[]}`
- Worth the cost — nothing in any competing registry surfaces this

**NEW `exchange_flows`** — $0.003
- Net BTC/ETH inflow/outflow to exchange wallets with directional attribution
- Upgrade from `whale_activity` into a true sell-pressure signal
- Start with Option B (free): Etherscan V2 + maintained list of ~500 known exchange hot wallets
- Upgrade to CryptoQuant (~$50/month) when revenue supports it
- Output: `{asset, net_flow_usd_24h, inflow_usd, outflow_usd, signal, top_exchanges[]}`

**FIX `fear_greed_index`** — cache + token sentiment
- Cache response for 6 hours in gateway memory (it updates once/day — stop re-fetching)
- Return `cache_age_hours` so bots can decide if data is fresh enough
- Optional: add per-token sentiment via Santiment free social volume tier

**FIX `crypto_news`** — demote or replace
- Option A (quick): rename to `community_sentiment`, drop price $0.003 → $0.001, be honest it's lagging
- Option B (better): replace Reddit with LunarCrush (X/Twitter + Reddit + news, free tier covers top 50 tokens)
- Option B is the right long-term call — build after `liquidation_heatmap`

---

## Backlog — Later

Lower urgency. Revisit when revenue supports API costs or specific user demand appears.

| Tool | Effort | Price | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|-------|
| `social_sentiment` | 2 days | $0.003 | Full LunarCrush replacement for `crypto_news`. Build after `liquidation_heatmap`. |
| `miner_flows` | 2 days | $0.002 | BTC miner outflows via CryptoQuant free tier. BTC-specific — build when BTC strategy users appear. |
| `wallet_balance` USD valuation | ½ day | — | Add `usd_value` per token + `usd_total` using internal `token_price` call |
| `defi_tvl` APY | ½ day | — | Add APY from DeFiLlama yields endpoint alongside TVL |

## Infrastructure

**Custom domain** — `agentpay.tools` 🔜 still pending as of April 21, 2026
- Domain was available April 15 — still not resolving (ECONNREFUSED on agentpay.tools)
- Railway subdomain explicitly penalises quality score in Bazaar's ranking algorithm
- ~$10-15/year. Point CNAME to Railway service URL, add domain in Railway settings.
- Do before Bazaar registration

**Bazaar / x402 discovery indexing** 🔜 still pending as of April 21, 2026
- Verified: `outputSchema` is NOT yet in `base.py:build_payment_required_header`
- Coinbase's CDP facilitator already handles Base payments (Mode A) — plumbing is there
- Missing: `outputSchema` in the `accepts` array of the `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header
- Fix: update `base.py:build_payment_required_header` to embed tool `parameters` + `response_example` as `outputSchema`
- After fix + custom domain: one Base mainnet payment through CDP facilitator triggers automatic indexing
- No manual registration step

**Exchange wallet list maintenance**
- Scheduled task runs 1st of each month
- Outputs audit report to `exchange_wallet_audit.md` for manual review
- Currently missing: Bitget, MEXC, Crypto.com, KuCoin, Bithumb, HTX
